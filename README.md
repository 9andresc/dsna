# DSNA (Data Structures 'N' Algorithms)

My practices of Data Structures and Algorithms using several languages (just for fun) in the long run.

## Algorithms

### Binary Search

It halves your _ordered_ array and compares your value with the middle element. If your value is equal to the middle element it returns the index of the later, but if it's less than the middle element, it should do the same process in the left halve, and if it's greater, it will search on the right halve. This task will go on until it matches the element with your value or there are no more halves, in which case, it will return -1.

_Iterative implementations_:

- Python 3
